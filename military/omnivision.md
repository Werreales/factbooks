Omnivision is a public establishment of the Department of National Surveillance of the Ministry of National Security (MNS). It was created by the Genelianus' Government on November 1<sup>st</sup>, 2017. This organization manages and operates the national surveillance network, called the Omnivision Anticriminal Predictive System (OAPS). This system is a network of surveillance technologies, including CCTV and real-time crime prediction centers working by artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Each Werai city has an Omnivision relay. Relays are in permanent communication with the whole network, working under asynchronous and decentralized data transfers.

Omnivision was not smoothly put in place. Shortly after it was launched, the system provoked widespread disapproval because of its possible anti-democratic and authoritarian uses. At the time, because the system was unperfect, it was pinned for several prediction errors. This raised concerns about false crime predictions, abusive arrests and racial profiling. Since, it has undergone several changes over time, with legal reforms and technical updates. Thanks to these, Omnivision has a level of precision unmatched anywhere else. However still today, national surveillance is considered unconstitutional by ONGs and some countries.

Omnivision's headquarters are the Omnivision Central Bureau (OCB), located in Werreales' capital city. Headquarters are responsible for coordinating and supervising national surveillance. Coordination is done by directives decided by the Central Bureau and dispatched to relays. The Omnivision Central Bureau has a permanent two-way communication channel with the Ministry of Homeland Security. This channel enables real-time communication between Police and the Central Office, allowing a quick and effective intervention of the police. Implementation of this surveillance system has proved very effective in the fight against crime. According to recent data published by the MHS, only one crime is committed every hour on average, making the Galactic Federation of Werreales one of the safest countries in the New World Union.
