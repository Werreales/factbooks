title: Werreales Identication System
---

The Werreales Identication System (abbreviated WIS) is a database that identifies all entities within the Galactic Federation of Werreales. It is used for various purposes: _inter alia_, efficient maintenance of infrastructure; fight against illegal trafficking of arms, drugs and goods; and fight against theft and degradation of public goods. This system was designed and is maintained by the Department of Identication of the Ministry of National Security (MNS).

## Identication key

An entity is identified by a unique code, called the _identication key_ (abbreviated IDk). An IDk is composed of four parts: a national code, (sub)categories, an item number and a version. These parts are separated by an hyphen.

**National Code**
: ISO code of the country that produced the entity.
**Categories**
: Categories and subcategories are used to classify entites. They can be considered as mere folders.
**Item number**
: An identification number unique to the category and assigned to the entity.
**Version**
: A code that points to a certain version of the entity in time.
