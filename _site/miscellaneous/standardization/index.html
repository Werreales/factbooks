<hr>

<p>The Werreales Standardization System (abbreviated WSS) is a database that identifies all entities within the Galactic Federation of Werreales. It is used for various purposes: <em>inter alia</em>, efficient maintenance of infrastructure; fight against illegal trafficking of arms, drugs and goods; and fight against theft and degradation of public goods. This system was designed and is maintained by the Department of Standardization of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, Agriculture, Industry and Innovation (METAII).</p>

<h2 id="identication-key">Identication key</h2>

<p>An entity is identified by a unique code, called the <em>identication key</em> (abbreviated IDk). An IDk is composed of four parts: a national code, (sub)categories, an item number and a version. These parts are separated by an hyphen.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>National Code</strong></dt>
  <dd>ISO code of the country that produced the entity.
<strong>Categories</strong></dd>
