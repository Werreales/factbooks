Werreales is a representative democracy. It means the people exercise their power by the mean of political parties. Every citizen is free to create or join a political party.

Since its foundation, Werreales aspires for a better and prosperous future. In contrast with Japan, the country is profoundly progressive from a political, social and economic point of view. Progressivism is an ideal defended by a major part of Werai political parties. As such, differences between parties lie essentially in the way of governing the country. There are three mainstream political parties, from the left, the moderate and the right.
