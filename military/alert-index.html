title: Military Alert Index

<p>The military alert system was set up by the Ministry of Defense and Galactic Surveillance (MDGS) with the aim of effectively coordinating the actions of the army with the decisions of the executive. This tool allows a quick implementation of defense measures in case of dangerous situation.

  <dd>This is the lowest level existing. It corresponds to a situation of eternal peace and stability. Armed forces and external defense infrastructure would be deactivated until re-evaluation of the alert index. Weapons of mass destruction and the Dome would be turned off. All active military personnel would be assigned to the reserve and will have to integrate into civilian life and participate in the prosperity of Werreales. However, the anti-criminal system in place (Omnivision) would continue to function even in peacetime. This level of alert, or rather of non-alert, has never been decreed in Werreales for the simple reason that it is a utopian situation.
  
  <dt><b style="background-color: green; color: white">MAI1</b> <small>Codename: SENTINEL</small>
  <dd>This alert level is used during periods of relative peace and stability. This level allows a low activity for army and external defense equipment. The Dome would be activated and would operate in normal mode. Weapons of Mass Destruction would be deactivated to protect the world. This level does not allow sendings of troops abroad. Police and taskforces' patrols are organized moderately.
