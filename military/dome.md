The Dome is a defense system against external threats set up by the Ministry of Defense and Galactic Surveillance (MDGS), in partnership with Cyber Inc. It is an electromagnetic force dome that destroys any unidentified object during its crossing. The system exploits the database of the Department of Identication of the Ministry of National Security (MNS). The Dome protects the Prefecture of Chikyū from foreign threats by including the cities of Wakoku (except the Pacific Islands), Hankoku and Mongoku.

The Dome is an extremely energy-consuming infrastructure. Thus, it has its own electricity network, dissociated from the civil distribution network. In addition, the electromagnetic force generated is so powerful that it is considered harmful by the Werai Congress of Physicians. Chikyū Prefecture's building layout is subject to strict regulations to limit electromagnetic poisoning, a sanitary plague on the prefectural scale.

The effectiveness of the Dome is evidenced by the Ministry's figures, which reflect a decline in external attacks and the eradication of illegal crossings in Werai waters.
